# README
## This is the README for "Monokai Terraform"
This pallet was drafted as the default Monokai formatting was hard on the eyes with its use of underlying, and also lack of embracing the full capabilities of Terraform's highlighting. In researching through various themes, I had yet to find one that worked for me so here it is.

I would recommend integrating with [Theme by Language](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jsaulou.theme-by-language) by Julien Saulou. 

In interim I have raised a [ticket](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/148013) with the Monokai base theme to have them review my changes for potential integration.

Sample formatting:
